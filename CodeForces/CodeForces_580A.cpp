/*Kefa decided to make some money doing business on the Internet for exactly n days. He knows that on the i-th day (1 ≤ i ≤ n)
he makes ai money. Kefa loves progress, that's why he wants to know the length of the maximum non-decreasing subsegment in sequence ai.
Let us remind you that the subsegment of the sequence is its continuous fragment. A subsegment of numbers is called non-decreasing if all
numbers in it follow in the non-decreasing order.

Help Kefa cope with this task!
